### need to set the imagestream that will be used by the tests
#base_images:
#  python:
#    name: "python"
#    namespace: "openshift"
#    tag: "3.8"

## not sure why, but if i didn't set this here but only
## inside tests step it failed
resources:
  '*':
    requests:
      cpu: 100m
      memory: 100Mi

#credentials:
#- namespace: test-credentials # this entry injects the custom credential
#  name: my-data
#  mount_path: /var/run/my-data

## here the tests start
tests:
- as: foo
  steps:
    ref:
      as: bar
      commands: print('it works')
      resources:
        requests:
          cpu: 100m
          memory: 200Mi
      from_image:
        namespace: openshift
        name: python
        tag: "3.8"
