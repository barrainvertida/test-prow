## need to set the imagestream that will be used by the tests
base_images:
  python:
    name: "python"
    namespace: "openshift"
    tag: "3.8"

## not sure why, but if i didn't set this here but only
## inside tests step it failed
resources:
  '*':
    requests:
      cpu: 100m
      memory: 100Mi

## here the tests start
tests:
- as: "test"
  commands: "print('it works')"
  container:
    from: "python"
    clone: false
  credentials:
  - namespace: test-credentials # this entry injects the custom credential
    name: my-data
    mount_path: /var/run/my-data
